What is EITD
------------

EITD ("EDGE in the Dark") is an open source vesion of the
engine used in the Alone in the Dark (AITD) and sequels. It
is based off of fitd ("Free in the Dark").

*special notice:
----------------------------

This is a massive hack-job/WIP until I get things more under
control!

What is supported
-----------------

AITD1:
      Should be completable. Saving and loading is supported,
      but only one slot is available (the screen to select the
      save position is not implemented). It's possible to load
      a savegame from the original game, provided it's file is
      named "save0.itd" (rename it if necessary). Like wise,
      it is possible to load a FITD save in the original engine.
      There is a big issue concerning the projectils. Basically,
      guns, won't work, and throwing objects may produce strange
      result. Save before throwing anything, as the object may
      apprear in a wall...

AITD2:
      Supported but uncompletable. The introduction is buggy
      due to a regression in the script engine. Hit 'esc' to skip
      the intro (both parts) to bypass the bug .Save/load is
      unsupported.

JACK:
      Supported but uncompletable.
      Save/load is unsupported.

AITD3:
      Supported but uncompletable.
      Save/load is unsupported.

How to use EITD
---------------

Build with CMake. Supports Windows and Unix, just like EDGE. Drop into folder with AITD release data and run.
